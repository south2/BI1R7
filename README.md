# body interaction vibrator development board

body interaction 1 board, revision 7

The *body interaction 1* is a tiny microcontroller board for building vibrating devices like (sex) toys. 
The vibration strength is controlled by motion. It is equipped with a radio module for wireless data transmission. 
The *body interaction 1* includes a LiPo battery and a capsuled vibration motor. 
Supports the Arduino IDE and Codebender.

*body interaction 1* is small, cheap and you can start at once. You can program the board with the Arduino software (IDE) or in a web browser (eg. codebender). A demo sketch is already uploaded to the board. Download 3D cases from [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com), print them, assemble the *body interaction 1* and have fun! Or invent your own toy using 3d modelling software.

#### More technical staff
*body interaction 1* has a Atmel Attiny84 on board, a LiPo charger (via USB) and a LiPo battery. The encapsuled vibration motor is controlled with PWM, though you can vary the vibration strength as needed. There are two additional I/O ports which can be used for other sensors or actuators. Programming is done with an ISP interface (2Ã—3 pole header). The board has BMA020 accelerometer and a RFM12B (915 or 868 Mhz) radio module. Size: approx. 20x36mm. Open Source Hardware. Supports the Arduino IDE as well as codebender.
You need an ISP programmer (eg. USB tiny ISP) for uploading *new* programs (sketches) to the *body interaction 1*. There are two options for the wireless transmission chip. You can select 868 MHz (EU) or 915MHz (US, Australia) radio module.
