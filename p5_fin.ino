/* body interaction 1 script "p5"
   hardware: body interaction 1 board
   www.bodyinteraction.com
   info@bodyinteraction.com

   The body interaction 1 board is based on the Jeenode Micro that uses for the communication the Hope RFM12b. In the context
   of wireless communication each body interaction board is a node.
   Motion is measured with the accelerometer BMA020. A vibration motor is driven with a simple  with transitor and diode.

   The script reads data from the accelorometer. Depending of the measured motion a vibration motor is speed up or slowed
   down. (Slow motion = reduce viration motor speed, fast motion = speed up). When the measured motion changes the motion data are send out and can be received by other BI1. In addition you can
   use a jeenode to receive the data and send them to a PC for further processing.
   At the same time this script listen to other body interaction boards which send their motion data
   to all listening nodes. When the measured motion of other body interaction board are different from the motion
   measured by this script, the vibration motor is adjusted (speed up or slowed down). So two or more body interaction boards
   can influence each other and syncronize after some time.

   There are 3 states (modes): active, pause, sleep

   active: In the active state the body interaction board behave like described above. When there is no motion and other boards don't
   send motion data the vibration motor is set to low vibration. After some time the state changes to pause.

   pause: In the pause state the vibration motor is off. But the body interaction board still listen to other body interaction board.
   If it receives motion data from an other board or wehn to motion of the borad itself changes the state is changed to active.
   If nothing happens the state is changes to sleeping after some time.

   sleeping: The body interaction board is set to sleep modus and saves battery power. After some tiem the board wakes up
   and read out the motion data. If the board is moved the state is changed to active.

   This code is in the public domain.
